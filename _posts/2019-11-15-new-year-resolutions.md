What are we doing Tony? Something contrived and self-serving? Something to occupy one's time with distractions? Or an attempt at something to stop the idling?
I've always had good intentions with new years resolutions but seldom kept them. So maybe history will repeat itself? Who knows? Who cares? So what?

With that spirit in mind, I'm building a new years resolution list. A backlog of things to keep me busy in 2020 of things to learn and do. I think
this will be better than starting a gym membership or vowing to lose weight. This list will be of things that I actually *want* to do, so hopefully
I won't need to much motivation.
