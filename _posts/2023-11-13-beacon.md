Recently, I wanted to find some way to signal in a passive way that didn't require any technology. 
I found an interesting looking Crystal on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:61172){:target="_blank"} that inspired me.
Using Adafruit's CircuitPython HttpServer deployed on a Raspberry Pi Pico, I wired up a series of multicolored LEDs that 
would interact with a simple API. The outcome is a beacon that can react to actions like pulse, persist, cycle and even 
morse code. My plan is to have some event stream that can interact with this API, so that I can signal to myself during 
work hours or simply something in a common area in the house that something needs attention.

Initial ideas like when the sump pump fires off, the internet goes out, or even when our house plant needs water. Still
contemplating this one. Results so far can be seen [here](https://github.com/amcnevin/beacon){:target="_blank"}.
