So the new year has gotten off to a start. Our bathroom remodel looks great. I've completed 2 books off my reading list. I quickly put together a simple [distance detector](https://github.com/amcnevin/ultrasonic_distance) for fun. And most importantly, our son has begun to walk!

I'm slowly saying my goodbyes to Chicago as we begin to prep for our move back east. I can't say what I'm going to miss as I'm sure it will hit me after we move, but I certainly won't miss the winters here.
